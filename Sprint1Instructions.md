## Our Project - Mindful Meals

Our project aims to aid university students, families, and more with managing their utilization of food, aiming to aid them in preventing food waste as well as introducing new recipes and dishes they can make with the food they have on hand.

We offer a platform where users can find new recipes they can cook with ingredients on hand while ensuring dietary needs and meal preferences are met. Furthermore, users users can view nutritional information on various foods and ingredients to further assist them in meal planning and preperation. Additionally, users are able to create personal accounts where they will be able to save recipes, post recipes, write reviews and more. As we continue working on development, we will strive to implement more features to boost functionality and user experience.

# Recipe Finder

This functionality allows users to search for recipes and filter by specific criteria. Users can filter by ingredients as well as dietary restriction,

To test this functionality you can input "chicken" and/or "onion" into the ingredient input to test the filtering functionality for ingredients. To test the dietary restriction filter, check the vegan or lactose-free box. To filter by both, you can input onion in the ingredient input and check off the vegan box.
