## Our Project - Mindful Meals

Our project aims to aid university students, families, and more with managing their utilization of food, aiming to aid them in preventing food waste as well as introducing new recipes and dishes they can make with the food they have on hand.

We offer a platform where users can find new recipes they can cook with ingredients on hand while ensuring dietary needs and meal preferences are met. Furthermore, users users can view nutritional information on various foods and ingredients to further assist them in meal planning and preperation. Additionally, users are able to create personal accounts where they will be able to save recipes, post recipes, write reviews and more. As we continue working on development, we will strive to implement more features to boost functionality and user experience.

## Functionalities

### Sign In/ Sign Up

This functionality allows users to make a personal account using their first and last name, email address and a password. If all the fields are successfully added to the fields and the account doesnâ€™t already exist then, the user is successfully able to sign into their accounts and access their profile page.

To test the sign up functionality, a jest test was created to test if the relevant text boxes are seen in the page

### Nutritional Information

This functionality allows users to browse nutritional information on ingredients

### Recipe Finder

This functionality allows users to search for recipes and filter by specific criteria. Users can filter by ingredients as well as dietary restriction,

To test this functionality you can input "chicken" and/or "onion" into the ingredient input to test the filtering functionality for ingredients. To test the dietary restriction filter, check the vegan or lactose-free box. To filter by both, you can input onion in the ingredient input and check off the vegan box.
